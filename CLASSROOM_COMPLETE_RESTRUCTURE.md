# Classroom Complete Restructure

## Overview
This document details the complete restructuring of the classroom page based on detailed user feedback. The redesign addresses specific requirements for layout, navigation, visual design, and functionality.

## User Requirements Addressed

### 1. Student List Changes
**Requirement**: "It should be a list, with lines in between each student and the box should cover a good chunk but have a slim width, and instead of emojis, just use the gradient person icon pfp that's greyed and circular."

**Implementation**:
- **Vertical list layout**: Changed from horizontal grid to vertical list
- **Lines between students**: Added `border-b border-gray-700/30` between each student row
- **Slim width container**: Used `max-w-2xl mx-auto` for narrow container
- **Gradient person icons**: Replaced emojis with `User` icon in circular gradient background
- **Full-width coverage**: Each student entry spans the full container width

```typescript
<div className="space-y-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-800/30 to-gray-900/30 backdrop-blur-sm border border-gray-700/50 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
  {classMembers.map((member, index) => (
    <motion.div className={`
      flex items-center gap-4 p-4 hover:bg-gray-700/30 transition-all
      ${index < classMembers.length - 1 ? 'border-b border-gray-700/30' : ''}
    `}>
      <div className="w-12 h-12 bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-600 to-gray-700 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <User className="h-6 w-6 text-gray-300" />
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### 2. Dashboard Renamed to Home
**Requirement**: "'Dashboard' should be called Home"

**Implementation**:
- Updated tab ID from `'dashboard'` to `'home'`
- Changed tab label from "Dashboard" to "Home"
- Updated icon to `Home` instead of `Calendar`
- Updated all references and navigation logic

### 3. Redesigned Announcements
**Requirement**: "announcements need to kinda be shaped differently, it needs to be big header text, the announcement message, and fake attachment files"

**Implementation**:
- **Big header text**: Used `text-3xl font-bold` for announcement titles
- **Enhanced message display**: Larger text with better typography (`text-lg leading-relaxed`)
- **Fake attachment files**: Added comprehensive attachment system with file types, icons, and interactive elements

```typescript
interface Announcement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  teacher: string;
  timestamp: string;
  priority: 'normal' | 'important' | 'urgent';
  pinned?: boolean;
  attachments: { name: string; type: string }[]; // New attachment system
}

// Sample attachments
attachments: [
  { name: 'Quiz Study Guide.pdf', type: 'pdf' },
  { name: 'Practice Questions.docx', type: 'doc' },
  { name: 'Speaker Bio.pdf', type: 'pdf' },
  { name: 'Company Overview.pptx', type: 'ppt' }
]
```

### 4. Centralized Home Page
**Requirement**: "the 'Home' part needs to be centralized, and the home page is centralized with everything but slightly smaller, anything on it, should have it's on tab, including the calendar"

**Implementation**:
- **Centralized layout**: Used `max-w-4xl mx-auto` for centered, smaller container

- **Separate tabs**: Created individual tabs for Calendar, Grades, and other features
- **Overview cards**: Quick stats, recent updates, and upcoming events

```typescript
const renderHome = () => (
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <div className="text-center mb-8">
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Great to see you {currentUser.name}!</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-400">Welcome back to your cybersecurity classroom</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
