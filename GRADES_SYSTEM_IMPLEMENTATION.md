## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface GradeAssignment {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  course: string;
  courseCode: string;
  type: 'quiz' | 'assignment' | 'project' | 'exam' | 'lab';
  grade: number;
  maxPoints: number;
  submissionDate: string;
  dueDate: string;
  weight: number; // Percentage weight in final grade
}

interface CourseGrades {
  courseCode: string;
  courseName: string;
  assignments: GradeAssignment[];
  average: number;
  creditHours: number;
}
```

### Color Coding Function
```typescript
const getGradeColor = (percentage: number) => {
  if (percentage < 50) return 'text-red-400 bg-red-500/10 border-red-500/30';
  if (percentage >= 60 && percentage <= 79) return 'text-yellow-400 bg-yellow-500/10 border-yellow-500/30';
  if (percentage >= 80 && percentage <= 89) return 'text-green-400 bg-green-500/10 border-green-500/30';
  if (percentage >= 90) return 'text-blue-400 bg-blue-500/10 border-blue-500/30';
  return 'text-gray-400 bg-gray-500/10 border-gray-500/30'; // 50-59 range
};
```

### Weighted Average Calculation
```typescript
courseGrades.forEach(course => {
  const totalWeight = course.assignments.reduce((sum, assignment) => sum + assignment.weight, 0);
  const weightedSum = course.assignments.reduce((sum, assignment) => {
    return sum + (assignment.grade / assignment.maxPoints * 100) * assignment.weight;
  }, 0);
  course.average = totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
});
```
