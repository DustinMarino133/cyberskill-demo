# Teacher Settings Page Documentation

## Overview
The teacher settings page (`src/app/teacher/settings/page.tsx`) provides a comprehensive interface for teachers to manage their account, security, notifications, and teaching preferences. This is completely separate from student settings and focuses on professional/educational needs.

## Key Features

### 1. Profile Information Section (Lines 145-220)
```typescript
// Professional teacher profile with educational-specific fields
const [profile, setProfile] = useState<TeacherProfile>({
  id: '1',
  name: 'Sarah Johnson',
  email: 'sarah.johnson@cyberskill.edu',
  phone: '+1 (555) 123-4567',
  department: 'Computer Science & Cybersecurity',
  employeeId: 'CS-2024-001',
  officeLocation: 'Technology Building, Room 234',
  teachingExperience: 8,
  subjects: ['Advanced Cybersecurity', 'Network Security', 'Digital Forensics'],
  preferredLanguage: 'English',
  timezone: 'America/New_York'
});
```

**Explanation**: Unlike student profiles that focus on gaming elements (coins, XP, badges), teacher profiles contain professional information relevant to education - employee ID, office location, department, and teaching experience.

### 2. Teacher-Specific Security Settings (Lines 255-350)
```typescript
// Security settings with privacy controls for teacher-student interactions
const [privacy, setPrivacy] = useState({
  profileVisibility: 'public',
  showOnlineStatus: true,
  allowStudentMessages: true,
  shareContactInfo: false
});
```

**Explanation**: Teachers have unique privacy needs, like controlling whether students can message them directly or see their online status, which are irrelevant for student accounts.

### 3. Professional Notification System (Lines 400-450)
```typescript
// Teaching-focused notification categories
{ key: 'assignmentReminders', label: 'Assignment Reminders', desc: 'Reminders about assignment deadlines' },
{ key: 'gradeNotifications', label: 'Grade Notifications', desc: 'Notifications when students submit work' },
{ key: 'classUpdates', label: 'Class Updates', desc: 'Updates about your classes and students' },
```

**Explanation**: Teacher notifications focus on class management, grading, and student activity rather than achievements or game progress that students see.

### 4. Teaching Profile Sidebar (Lines 500-550)
```typescript
// Teaching credentials and quick stats
<CardTitle className="text-white flex items-center gap-2">
  <GraduationCap className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-400" />
  Teaching Profile
</CardTitle>
<Badge className="bg-blue-500/20 text-blue-300">
  {profile.teachingExperience} years
</Badge>
```

**Explanation**: Shows professional credentials like years of experience, subjects taught, and class statistics rather than gaming achievements.

### 5. No Gaming Elements
**Key Difference**: Unlike student settings, there are NO:
- Coin displays or management
- XP progress bars
- Achievement badges
- Level systems
- Gaming statistics

### 6. Professional Email Format (Line 39)
```typescript
email: 'sarah.johnson@cyberskill.edu',
```

**Explanation**: Uses institutional email format (.edu domain) to reflect the educational context rather than personal email addresses.

### 7. System Preferences (Lines 580-620)
```typescript
// Professional system preferences
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <div>
    <p className="text-slate-300">Auto-save</p>
    <p className="text-slate-500 text-xs">Automatically save changes</p>
  </div>
```

**Explanation**: Focuses on productivity features like auto-save and system preferences that help teachers manage their workflow efficiently.

## Route Integration

### Navigation Integration (Line 80)
```typescript
router.push(user?.role === 'teacher' ? '/teacher/settings' : '/student/settings');
```

**Explanation**: The navbar profile popup now correctly routes teachers to their dedicated settings page instead of the student settings.

### Authentication Check (Lines 75-85)
```typescript
if (userData.role === 'teacher') {
  setUser({ ...userData, name: 'Sarah Johnson' });
} else {
  router.push('/auth/login');
}
```

**Explanation**: Ensures only authenticated teachers can access this page, with proper role-based routing.

## UI/UX Design

### Professional Color Scheme
- **Blue/Purple gradients**: Professional and authoritative
- **Clean layouts**: Focus on functionality over gaming aesthetics
- **Structured forms**: Educational institution style

### Responsive Design
- **Grid layouts**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works on tablets and phones for teacher mobility
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and contrast ratios

## State Management

### Unsaved Changes Detection (Lines 70-75)
```typescript
const [unsavedChanges, setUnsavedChanges] = useState(false);

const handleProfileUpdate = (field: keyof TeacherProfile, value: string | number | string[]) => {
  setProfile(prev => ({ ...prev, [field]: value }));
  setUnsavedChanges(true);
};
```

**Explanation**: Tracks when teachers make changes and provides visual feedback with a save prompt, preventing accidental data loss.

### Password Security (Lines 110-125)
```typescript
const handlePasswordChange = () => {
  if (newPassword !== confirmPassword) {
    alert('New passwords do not match!');
    return;
  }
  if (newPassword.length < 8) {
    alert('Password must be at least 8 characters long!');
    return;
  }
};
```

**Explanation**: Implements proper password validation with confirmation matching and minimum length requirements for security.

This teacher settings page creates a completely professional environment focused on educational needs rather than gamification, providing teachers with the tools they need to manage their classes effectively.
